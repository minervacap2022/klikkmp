> now I need you to connect to the real backend,

  you need to add a button on the website of
  "recording", which let this app to record audio,
  after the audio record, it processes this audio via
  /root/KK_asrdiar/cog-whisper-diarization/run_compl
  ete_pipeline.py, to process this audio, and return
  the processed results to the app frontend,


  the sample raw results is the following:
  /root/KK_pipelinetests/test_results/complete_pipel
  ine_1761911077.json,
  so you need to map the results in this output into
  each sections of the web, EVERYTHING SHOULD
  CAREFULLY follow the backend datasets, so if you
  need to change the frontend, go change it, as long
  as it can displays the results properly.
